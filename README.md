#🌍 Real-Time Air Quality Monitoring System

#📊 Project Overview
This project is a Real-Time Air Quality Monitoring System designed to fetch AQI (Air Quality Index) data from a government API, process it using Kafka producers, topics, and consumers, store it in a MySQL database, and display insights through a Flask-based web application and a Power BI dashboard.

#🚀 Key Features
  1.Real-Time Data Fetching: Fetches live AQI data from government APIs.
  2.Data Pipeline with Kafka: Utilizes Kafka producers, topics, and consumers for efficient data streaming.
  3.Database Integration: Stores processed data in MySQL for structured storage and querying.
  4.Web Interface with Flask: Provides a user-friendly interface for selecting a specific city and viewing AQI data.
  5.Interactive Dashboard: Displays insightful visualizations using Power BI.
  
🛠️ Technology Stack
  1.Backend: Flask, Python
  2.Streaming Platform: Apache Kafka
  3.Database: MySQL
  4.Frontend: HTML, CSS (index.html)
  5.Visualization Tool: Power BI
  6.API Integration: Government AQI API
  
#📊 Power BI Dashboard
  City-wise AQI Trends: Compare AQI levels across cities.
  Real-time Updates: See live AQI updates on the dashboard.
  Pollutant Breakdown: Visual representation of pollutants by type.
  
#🛡️ Future Enhancements
  Implement predictive analytics using Machine Learning for AQI forecasts.
  Add user authentication for personalized dashboards.
  Expand data sources to include IoT-based air quality sensors.
